## Railway

The repo contains a `railway.toml` with three services:
- `backend` (Go indexer + API)
- `frontend` (Vite UI + nginx proxy)
- `docs` (this portal)

Notes:
- Railway's private network hostnames use `*.railway.internal`.
- Backend and docs services should use internal URLs for service-to-service traffic.

## Docker

The portal includes `devportal/Dockerfile` and is compatible with Docker Compose.
